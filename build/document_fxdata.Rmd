This repository contains historical foreign exchange rate data in parquet format. 
The data is in all cases retrieved from official central bank sources. 
Information about available date ranges is provided in `<bank>_meta.json`.


## Central bank data sources

Central banks that make their data available in a format suitable for automatic 
updating and are used as sources for this data set include:

- `ecb`: European Central Bank, retrieved from:
  - https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/eurofxref/eurofxref-hist.zip
- `cbi`: Central Bank of Iceland, retrieved from:
  - https://sedlabanki.is/gagnatorg/xml-gogn/
- `fed`: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, retrieved from:
  - https://fred.stlouisfed.org/searchresults/?st=spot%20exchange%20rates


## Availability 

This table shows the availability of different currencies from the various
central bank sources. The table values refer to the first and last
availabilities from each source, but currencies may have gaps within these
periods for one or more sources due to temporary currency restrictions or other
reasons.

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}

d.gt.availability |> 
  mutate(across(3:last_col(), ~ifelse(is.na(.), ".", .))) |>
  knitr::kable(format = "markdown", align = c("l", "l", "c", "c", "c"))

```


## Note on quotation methods

Many central banks, such as the European Central Bank (ECB), use an indirect quotation approach, listing exchange rates as foreign currency per 1 EUR (e.g., 1 EUR = 1.20 USD). Other banks, such as the Central Bank of Iceland (CBI), use a direct quotation, expressing rates as ISK per 1 unit of foreign currency (e.g., 1 USD = 130 ISK). When handling exchange rate data, it's important to standardize or document these differing conventions to ensure accuracy. 

The metadata (`<bank>_meta.json`) for each bank includes  the `quotation_method` that each bank uses, (either `indirect` or `direct`). The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (FED) publishes rates in a mix of direct an indirect quotations, they quotes must be converted to a common method before inclusion. The indirect approach is used for the main data set (`fed`), but a data set with the direct approach is available as well (`xfed`).
